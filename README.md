# Basic Practice!

## Why?

Well, in my current role I don't get to consistently code. 
My main language has always been python, and whatever I needed over the last 3 years of this journey I've had to learn on the fly. 
By doing so, I've missed out on somethings, like c++, vim and markdown.!
I've always wanted to learn, but was to lazy. 
So! In an effort to be better, and make myself an overall a better engineer, I'm going to work on c++ mastery projects. 
Starting reaaaaal simple, and working to more complex stuff. 
This is repo should evolve over time, and I look forward to looking back on this readme after revisions the next couple months, years, and on.
